    <h1>Here's some more digital contributions</h1>
    <h2>A display of my part-time fun</h2>
    <h3>Coding!!--my 100DaysofPython challenge journey</h3>
    <p>It all started as a personal dare that I took out of curiosity and a need to build stuff-big stuff haha! Who said that you need the right time to start? The right time to start was actually in the beginning! Yes, that's the best time to begin any journey. The days before yesterday.</p>
    <h3>Enough talk-we shall get back to it</h3>
    <p>Here are some non-technical and invaluable skills I got from this journey:
      <ul>
    <li>Self initiative</li>
    <li>Courage to begin</li>
    <li>Collaboration</li>
    <li>Consistency and time management</li>
    <li>Creativity</li>
      
      </ul>

    <h2>Here are my favorite milestones of the journey</h2>

      <h3>Day47: TopGun Maverick</h3>
      On this day I got an inspiration from the TopGun franchise. I wrote a program to generate stats(rating,MIGs taken down, top mac speed) and compare for different characters from the Maverick movie. Guessed it right-the legend  never dies even against young blood like "Iceman".

       <h3>The Hangman Game</h3>
       I loved this one due to the word play. Ever played the popular hangman child game? Just hang in there with the words as you try this one out.

       <h3>Pizza Order System</h3>
       Place your orders here with the pizza order system I made. For the love of pizzas. This program takes user name, pizza order(type,size,qty and calculates total price).
